# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sodiq — Software Engineer | Builder of Digital Systems

Welcome to my GitHub space — a digital journal of my engineering journey where ideas become reality through code, curiosity, and continuous iteration.

## 💻 About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer with a focus on **frontend architecture**, **scalable backend systems**, and **product thinking**. Whether I'm designing expressive UI animations, building real-time queue systems, or engineering event-driven microservices, I’m always driven by a clear principle: **clarity meets craftsmanship**.

Currently exploring the future of:

- **Web-Scale Backend Systems**  
- **AI-Powered Applications**  
- **Human-Centered Developer Tools**  
- **Smart Infrastructure & DevOps Pipelines**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Here's what I use to architect and ship production-grade software:

### ⚙️ Backend

- **Go (Golang)** — My weapon of choice for building fast, maintainable backend services.
- **Gin Framework** — Lightweight yet powerful framework for RESTful APIs.
- **Python** - for web scraping.
- **Postgres** - For database
- **GORM** — ORM for managing SQL/NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and SQLite.
- **Redis** — For caching and rate limiting.
- **RabbitMQ / Pub-Sub / WebSocket Hubs** — Real-time event-driven communication.

### 💻 Frontend

- **React (and React Native)** — My go-to for building clean, responsive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** — For design systems and utility-first styling.
- **GSAP** — When animation needs to feel expressive and alive.
- **Next.js (learning in progress)** — For fullstack and server-side rendering.

### 🧠 AI/ML & Media

- **OpenAI API** — Powering conversational interfaces and AI simulations.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) & ffmpeg** — For AI-generated podcast audio workflows.

### 🧰 Dev Tools

- **Postman** — For API testing and workflow automation.
- **Docker** — Containerizing services (especially Redis and Go apps).
- **Git & GitHub** — Version control, obviously.
- **VSCode & GoLand** — Crafting software with precision.

## 🔥 Side Projects (Highlight Reel)


- **🏥 EventManager**  
  → ombining RESTful architecture, JWT-based authentication, event-driven email dispatch, and Redis-powered caching.

- **🔒 Ciplock – Auth as a Service**  
  → Scalable authentication backend built with Go, JWT, refresh tokens, and a clean dashboard.

- **🌾 EchoBridge**  
  → This Go-based web application seamlessly syncs playlists between Spotify, YouTube Music, and soon, Apple Music. It authenticates with multiple platforms, fetches playlist tracks, searches for corresponding content, and creates or updates playlists, automating your music migration.

- **🏠 Urbannest**  
  → A marketplace for short-term rentals in Lagos, complete with reviews, calendars, and payments.
